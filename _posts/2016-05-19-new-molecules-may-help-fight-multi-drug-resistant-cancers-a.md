title: 'New molecules may help fight multi-drug resistant cancers  Australian researchers have discovered a new class of molecules originally derived from sea snails that are showing promising results against multi-drug resistant cancers. The discovery was made by scientists atUniversity of Wollongong (UOW) and Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute (IHMRI). The molecules calledN-alkylisatins killed 100 per cent of drug resistant cancer cells in just 48 hours, compared with a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat breast cancer which killed only 10 per cent of cells in the same time period. The finding was published in the journalHeliyon. '
