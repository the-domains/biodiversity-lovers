description: 'Australian researchers have discovered a new class of molecules originally derived from sea snails that are showing promising results against multi-drug resistant cancers. The discovery was made by scientists atUniversity of Wollongong (UOW) and Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute (IHMRI). The molecules calledN-alkylisatins killed 100 per cent of drug resistant cancer cells in just 48 hours, compared with a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat breast cancer which killed only 10 per cent of cells in the same time period. The finding was published in the journalHeliyon.  This info comes from a good article in Business Standard article.'
