Did you know that the Horse Shoe crab blood is blue ?  
The Horseshoe crab exist since 450 million years without a change. It is developing a blood with amazing antibacterial properties. We learned that the properties of the blood of this crab save our lives and that it is bright blue, a consequence of using copper-based hemocyanin to transport oxygen. We humans use iron in hemoglobin. Instead of white blood cells to fight infection, many invertebrates have amebocytes, and such a peak of refinement are of enormous medical value.
